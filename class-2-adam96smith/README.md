## Comments from Colm

Mark: 7/10

Not a complete solution - when I ran the notebook it failed at the cell that does the benchmarking. I think you accidentally deleted the definitions of arrays called N and NN. I subsequently noticed that it is defined in the subsequent cell - too late! I also noticed that you have some bad coding practices like using the variable name "N" to mean N Log N! 

The notebook was a bit messy with compilation and build messages. It would have been better to submit a "clean" version which you are sure runs all the way through - including creating the plots. 

Try to be a bit more careful in future and you will be fine.
